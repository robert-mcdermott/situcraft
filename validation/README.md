# Validation

`node validation/run.mjs [suite …] [--verbose] [--require-data]` runs the validation suites and
exits with status 1 when a check fails. Each check states what is compared, the value found and
the tolerance required.

| Suite | What it checks | Data |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `accessibility` | WCAG AA contrast of every text-on-surface pair in both themes, with color-vision-friendly colors off and on; palettes, status colors and diverging maps apart in protanopia, deuteranopia and tritanopia (Machado et al. 2009, CIEDE2000) | `web/styles.css` |

Later slices add the checks against independent references:
- the readers against independent readers on every file of the development bundles (wave 1,
  slice 2);
- segmentation against simulated truth and recorded reference numbers (waves 2–3).

Reference outputs are committed in `validation/reference/` with the script and tool version that
produced them. Public datasets are fetched and checksummed by `validation/fetch.mjs` into
`validation/cache/`, which is never stored in the repository (situcraft-spec/design.md,
"Development data").
